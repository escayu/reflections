When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working in a group
    When I want to access files from other devices and other places

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork It is to make a copy of a repository of another user in my account. 
    Changes made to my account are not transferred to the user who owns them.
	Clone It is copying an entire repository locally or remotely. 
	Changes made to the copy are transferred to the original.
	Branch. It is to create a version within a repository from a commit
